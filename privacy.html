      information when you use our application to access the Google Ads API for reporting and analysis.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

      Google Ads account performance.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google User Data:</strong> When you authenticate your Google account via OAuth 2.0, we collect necessary
          authentication tokens (access and refresh tokens) to access your Google Ads data.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Ads Account Data:</strong> We retrieve data associated with your Google Ads account, including but
          not limited to:
            <ul>
                <li>Campaign, Ad Group, and Keyword settings.</li>
                <li>Performance metrics (Impressions, Clicks, CPC, CTR, Conversions, Cost).</li>
                <li>Account hierarchy and configuration details.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Usage Logs:</strong> We may collect anonymous logs regarding the technical performance of the app 
          (e.g., API request success/failure rates) to help us debug and improve the application.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information collected strictly for the functionality of the Anash Test App:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Reporting & Analysis:</strong> To query the Google Ads API and generate the reports and performance analysis requested by you.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Export:</strong> To format and export your data into user-friendly formats (JSON, CSV) as directed by you.</li>
        <li><strong>Service Maintenance:</strong> To validate API requests and ensure the stability and security of the application.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your Google Ads data or personal information to outside parties.</strong></p>

    <h2>4. Google API Services User Data Policy (Limited Use Disclosure)</h2>
    <p>The Anash Test App's use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the
      <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy" target="_blank">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, 
      including the Limited Use requirements.</p>
    <p>Specifically:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We only request access to the specific data needed to perform the app’s features (reporting and analysis).</li>
        <li>We do not use your Google Ads data for advertising purposes, surveillance, or to train generalized AI/ML models.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Transient Processing:</strong> For many functions, data is fetched in real-time and processed temporarily to 
          generate your report.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> If you choose to save reports (CSV/JSON), these files are stored locally on your 
          device or within your specific instance of the application. We do not maintain a central server that permanently 
          archives your sensitive advertising data.</li>
        <li><strong>Token Security:</strong> OAuth tokens are stored securely using industry-standard encryption and are 
          used solely to maintain your authorized session.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
    <p>We do not share your personal data or Google Ads data with third parties, except in the following limited circumstances:</p>

          time via your <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" target="_blank">Google Account Security settings</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Deletion:</strong> Upon revocation of access, the app will no longer be able to fetch data. You may 
          manually delete any local reports or files generated by the app.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Security</h2>
    <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data against unauthorized access, 
      alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, please note that no method of transmission over the internet or 
      electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy 
      Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.</p>
